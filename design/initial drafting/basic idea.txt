>>Highest level idea:
A card game simulation.
Involing 1 human player vs between 2 and 100 computer players

>>Component parts:
Simulation involes a card table.  And an overall score card.
Each player will have:
  --A hand of cards, 
  --A running score on the scoreboard, 
  --A notifcation of the round and the card trumps that round and a view of the card table when a game is in play.
  --A view of who is dealer that round and who is dealing a card during a round.
There will be an appropriately sized desk of cards based on the number of players
The random selection of a dealer of the cards
A gui interface to get the initial set up information
A gui interface for each round and a view of the score card
